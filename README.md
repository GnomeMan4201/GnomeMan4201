Research Focus

· Offensive Security Tooling
· Adversarial Machine Learning
· Network Security & Penetration Testing
· Automated Red Team Infrastructure

## Core Projects

OWN

Advanced Network Reconnaissance Platform

· Discovers exposed endpoints, APIs, and services
· Maps complete external attack surfaces
· Identifies technology stacks and potential entry points

LANimals

Real-time Network Intelligence Suite

· Live network visualization and device fingerprinting
· Service enumeration and traffic pattern analysis
· Adversary simulation and defensive countermeasure detection

Blackglass Suite

Covert Operations Platform

· Secure communication channel establishment
· Payload mutation and evasion techniques
· Anonymous research environment management

badBANANA

Adversarial ML Research Framework

· Model vulnerability assessment and exploitation
· Poisoning and evasion attack simulations
· Defensive AI hardening validation

## Real-World Usage Scenarios

Scenario 1: Comprehensive Security Assessment

```
1. OWN → Discovers web applications and APIs at target.com
2. LANimals → Maps internal network after initial access
3. Blackglass → Establishes covert C2 channels
4. badBANANA → Tests ML-based security systems for weaknesses
```

Scenario 2: Red Team Operation

```
OWN (External Mapping) → Finds vulnerable API endpoint
↓
LANimals (Lateral Movement) → Discovers internal ML model server
↓
badBANANA (AI Exploitation) → Compromises model integrity
↓
Blackglass (Stealth Exfiltration) → Securely extracts model data
```

Scenario 3: Defensive Research

```
badBANANA (Identify ML Vulnerabilities) → LANimals (Test Network Detection) → OWN (Validate External Exposure) → Blackglass (Secure Reporting)
```
