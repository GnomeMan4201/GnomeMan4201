# About Me
Self-taught **Security Researcher & Tool Developer** with over 5 years of experience building and breaking systems.  
Specialized in **offensive security tooling**, **network reconnaissance**, and **adversarial machine learning**—developing tools that prove capability through execution, not credentials.

> No degree. No certifications. Just tools that work.

**Profiles:**

**Advanced Network Reconnaissance Platform**

- Discovers exposed endpoints, APIs, and services  
- Maps external attack surfaces with version detection  
- Identifies technology stacks and potential entry points  

---

### [LANimals](https://github.com/GnomeMan4201/LANimals)
**Real-time Network Intelligence Suite**

- Live network visualization and device fingerprinting  
- Service enumeration and traffic pattern analysis  
- Adversary simulation and countermeasure detection  

---

### [Blackglass Suite](https://github.com/GnomeMan4201/Blackglass_Suite)
**Covert Operations Platform**

- Secure communication channel establishment  
- Payload mutation and evasion automation  
- Anonymous research environment management  

---

### [bad_BANANA](https://github.com/GnomeMan4201/bad_BANANA)
**Adversarial ML Research Framework**

- Model vulnerability assessment and exploitation  
- Poisoning and evasion attack simulations  
- Defensive AI hardening validation  

---

# Real-World Use Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Comprehensive Security Assessment**

1. OWN → Maps exposed infrastructure at target.com


2. LANimals → Profiles internal network after initial access


3. Blackglass → Establishes covert communication


4. bad_BANANA → Evaluates AI/ML defenses for weaknesses



**Scenario 2: Red Team Operation**

OWN (External Mapping) → Finds vulnerable API endpoint ↓ LANimals (Lateral Movement) → Discovers internal ML model server ↓ bad_BANANA (AI Exploitation) → Compromises model integrity ↓ Blackglass (Stealth Exfiltration) → Securely extracts model data

**Scenario 3: Defensive Research**

bad_BANANA → Identify ML vulnerabilities
LANimals → Test network detection
OWN → Validate external exposure
Blackglass → Securely report and mitigate
